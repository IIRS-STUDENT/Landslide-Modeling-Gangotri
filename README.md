# Landslide-Modeling-Gangotri
This code models the landslide susceptibility of the Upper Bhagirathi basin using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms. It comprehensively addresses all aspects of susceptibility modeling, from data preparation using causative factors, to multicollinearity analysis with Pearson correlation, and accuracy assessment through precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
